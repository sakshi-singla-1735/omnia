# This file is used to specify the network configuration.
#
# 'admin_network' is a mandatory field, essential for PXE boot and host communication."
#
# The 'admin_network' section contains the following variables:
# - 'oim_nic_name': The name of the interface on the OIM server associated with the admin network.
# - 'netmask_bits': The number of bits in the subnet mask.
# - 'primary_oim_admin_ip': The admin IP address of the OIM server which is configured.
# - 'primary_oim_bmc_ip': The iDRAC  IP address of the OIM server,
#     Mandatory only if idrac_telemetry is set to true and telemetry data needs to be collected from the OIM server.
#     Optional — can be omitted if iDRAC telemetry for the OIM server is not required.
# - 'dynamic_range': The range of dynamic IP addresses available on the admin network.
# - 'dns': The list of external DNS server IP address for the admin network.
# - 'ntp_servers': The list of NTP servers for the admin network. Each NTP server entry should include: 
#     - 'address': The IP address or hostname of the NTP server.
#     - 'type': The type of NTP entry, either 'server' or 'pool'.
#     Example:  
#     ntp_servers:
#       - { address: "172.16.10.80", type: "server" }

# 'ib_network' is a mandatory field, essential for IB network configuration.
# The 'ib_network' section contains the following variables:
# - 'subnet': The subnet of the IB network.
# - 'netmask_bits': The number of bits in the subnet mask. This value must be same as the admin_network netmask_bits.
