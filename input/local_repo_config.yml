# VARIABLE DETAILS
# ================================
# 1. user_repo_url_x86_64
#--------------------------
#    Optional list of user-defined repository URLs for x86_64 architecture.
#    Each entry can include: url, gpgkey, sslcacert, sslclientkey, sslclientcert, name, policy.
#    Used for custom cluster packages like <arch>_slurm_custom.
# Fields:
#   url         : Base URL of the repository
#   gpgkey      : GPG key URL (leave empty to disable gpgcheck; Omnia will trust this repo and user is responsible for its security)
#   name        : Name of the repository
#   sslcacert   : Path to SSL CA certificate (if using SSL)
#   sslclientkey: Path to SSL client key (if using SSL)
#   sslclientcert: Path to SSL client certificate (if using SSL)
#   policy      : Repository policy (always, partial)
# Notes:
#   - Do not use Jinja variables in this configuration.
#   - Omit SSL fields entirely if SSL is not in use.
#   - Its a madatory field in case of slurm_custom with name as '<arch>_slurm_custom'
#
# 2. user_repo_url_aarch64
#---------------------------
#    Same as above but for aarch64 architecture.
#
# 4. rhel_os_url_x86_64
#-----------------------------
#    Mandatory when RHEL subscription is not registered.
#    Contains repository URLs for codeready-builder, baseos, and appstream for x86_64.
# Fields:
#   url         : Base URL of the repository
#   gpgkey      : GPG key URL (leave empty to disable gpgcheck; Omnia will trust this repo and user is responsible for its security)
#   sslcacert   : Path to SSL CA certificate (if using SSL)
#   sslclientkey: Path to SSL client key (if using SSL)
#   sslclientcert: Path to SSL client certificate (if using SSL)
#   policy      : Repository policy if mentioned allowed values (always, partial). IF not mentioned will consider from software_config.json
#   name        : Name of the repository [ Allowed repo names <arch>_codeready-builder, <arch>_appstream, <arch>_baseos
# Notes:
#   - Do not use Jinja variables in this configuration.
#   - Omit SSL fields entirely if SSL is not in use.
#   - RHEL subscription is not registered, All 3 repositories [ <arch>_codeready-builder, <arch>_appstream, <arch>_baseos ]entries
#      are mandatory.
#
# 5. rhel_os_url_aarch64
#----------------------------
#    Same as above but for aarch64 architecture.
#
#### ADVANCE CONFIGURATIONS FOR LOCAL REPO ###
# 6. omnia_repo_url_rhel_x86_64
#-------------------------------
#    Mandatory repository URLs for downloading RPMS for Omnia features on RHEL x86_64.
#    Each entry includes url, gpgkey, and name.
#
# This variable defines all the repo urls from where rpms will be downloaded for omnia features when cluster_os_type is rhel and arch x86_64
# Making incorrect changes to this variable can cause omnia failure. Please edit cautiously.
# Fields:
#  url        : Base URL of the repository.
#  gpgkey     : URL of the GPG key for the repository.
#                   If left empty, gpgcheck=0 for that repository.
#  name       : A unique identifier for the repository or registry.
#
# 7. omnia_repo_url_rhel_aarch64
#--------------------------------
#    Same as above but for RHEL aarch64.
#
# 8. additional_repos_x86_64
#----------------------------
#    Optional list of additional repository URLs for x86_64 architecture.
#    These repos are aggregated into a single Pulp repository, allowing dynamic
#    addition/removal without changing compute node configurations.
# Fields:
#   url           : Base URL of the repository (required)
#   gpgkey        : GPG key URL (required, can be empty - disables gpgcheck)
#   name          : Unique name for the repository (required)
#   sslcacert     : Path to SSL CA certificate (optional)
#   sslclientkey  : Path to SSL client key (optional)
#   sslclientcert : Path to SSL client certificate (optional)
# Notes:
#   - All repos are synced into a single aggregated Pulp repository
#   - Compute nodes are configured once with a fixed URL that never changes
#   - Policy is controlled globally via repo_config in software_config.json (per-entry policy not supported)
#   - Name must be unique within this list and must not conflict with names in other repo keys
#   - Packages from these repos can only be used via additional_packages.json
#
# 9. additional_repos_aarch64
#-----------------------------
#    Same as above but for aarch64 architecture.
