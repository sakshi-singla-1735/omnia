def main():

    The main function of the module.

    This function sets up the argument specifications for the module and initializes the logger.
    It then retrieves the `local_config` and `log_dir` parameters from the module.

    The `local_config` parameter is used to replace single quotes with double quotes to make it valid JSON.
    The JSON string is then parsed and stored in the `rpm_config` variable.

    The `manage_rpm_repositories_multiprocess` function is called with the `rpm_config` and `log` as arguments.

    Finally, the function exits with a JSON response indicating that the RPM configuration has been processed.

    Parameters:
        None

    Returns:
